# Exam Conten
## Response types
There are two types of questions on the exam:
</ul>
	<li>***Multiple choice:*** Has one correct response and three incorrect responses (distractors)</li>
	<li>***Multiple response:*** Has two or more correct responses out of five or more response options</li>
</ul>
Select one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the question. Distractors, or
incorrect answers, are response options that a candidate with incomplete knowledge or skill might choose.
Distractors are generally plausible responses that match the content area.
Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect; there is no penalty for guessing. The exam includes 50
questions that will affect your score.

# Unscored content
The exam includes 15 unscored questions that do not affect your score. AWS collects information about
candidate performance on these unscored questions to evaluate these questions for future use as scored
questions. These unscored questions are not identified on the exam

#Exam Results
The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam is a pass or fail exam. The exam is scored against a minimum
standard established by AWS professionals who follow certification industry best practices and guidelines.
Your results for the exam are reported as a scaled score of 100â€“1,000. The minimum passing score is 700.
Your score shows how you performed on the exam as a whole and whether or not you passed. Scaled
scoring models help equate scores across multiple exam forms that might have slightly different difficulty
levels.
Your score report may contain a table of classifications of your performance at each section level. This
information is intended to provide general feedback about your exam performance. The exam uses a
compensatory scoring model, which means that you do not need to achieve a passing score in each
section. You need to pass only the overall exam.
Each section of the exam has a specific weighting, so some sections have more questions than others. The
table contains general information that highlights your strengths and weaknesses. Use caution when
interpreting section-level feedback.
